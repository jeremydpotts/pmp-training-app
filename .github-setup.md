# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name it (e.g., "pmp-training-app")
5. Choose public or private
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME):

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/pmp-training-app
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using SSH

If you prefer SSH:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Note

The PDF files in `public/materials/` are large. If you encounter issues pushing due to file size limits, you may want to:
- Use Git LFS for large files, or
- Remove PDFs from git and host them separately
